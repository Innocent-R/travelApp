Project: Travel Destination Review

The Travel App is a full-stack web application that allows users to sign up and log in securely. Once logged in, users can select their favorite travel destinations and view detailed information and images about each city. All user and destination data are stored and managed in a database, ensuring a smooth and personalized experience.

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB

Lessons Learned:

While building this web app, I gained hands-on experience with database design using MongoDB, and implementing CRUD operations for posts and user interactions
